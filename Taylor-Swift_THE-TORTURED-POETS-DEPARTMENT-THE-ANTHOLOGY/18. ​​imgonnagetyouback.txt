Yeah

Lilac short skirt, the one that fits me like skin
Did your research, you knew the price going in
And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standing at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm going in (Yeah)

Whether I'm gonna be your wife, or
Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna curse you out, or
Take you back to my house, I haven't decidеd yet
But I'm gonna get you back

I-I hear thе whispers in your eyes
Oh, make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
(You're mine)

Small talk, big walk, act like I don't care what you did
I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid
And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can take the upper hand and touch your body
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
Or I might just love you 'til the end (Ah-ah-ah)


Whether I'm gonna be your wife, or
Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna flip you off, or
Pull you into the closet, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

I-I hear the whispers in your eyes
Oh, make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
(You're mine)

I can feel it coming, honey, in the way you move
Push the reset button, we're becoming something new
Say you got somebody else, say, "I got someone too"
Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leaving here with you
Bygones will be bygone, eras fading into grey (Fading into grey)
Rebuild all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)
Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same
Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way (Ha)

Whether I'm gonna be your wife, or
Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna curse you out, or
Take you back to my house, I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
I-I hear the whispers in your eyes
Oh make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine

I'm gonna get you back
