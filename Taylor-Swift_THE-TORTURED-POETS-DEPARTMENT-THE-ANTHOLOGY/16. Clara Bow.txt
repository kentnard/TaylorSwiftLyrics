You look like Clara Bow
In this light, remarkable
All your life, did you know
You'd be picked like a rose?

I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if it happened
Die if it happened to me
No one in my small town thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan

This town is fake but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling

You look like Stevie Nicks in '75
The hair and lips
The crowd goes wild at her fingertips
Half moonshinе, a full eclipse

I'm not trying to exaggеrate
But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it
No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in LA
They all want to say


This town is fake but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling

The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
Flesh and blood amongst war machines
You're the new god we're worshipping
Promise to be dazzling

Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours demanding more
Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
Do they let you know?
It's hell on earth to be heavenly
Them's the brakes, they don't come gently

You look like Taylor Swift
In this light, we're loving it
You've got edge, she never did
The future's bright, dazzling
